# UE5_ObstacleAssault
This repository contains a simple game developed using Unreal Engine 5, based on the course Unreal Engine 5 C++ Developer: Learn C++ &amp; Make Video Games. By using this game, I aim to create and implement automated test cases to better understand and develop testing strategies within Unreal Engine 5.
